# Tiny ML

Tiny ML is a simplified version of Standard ML, a functional programming language.  
This project implements a compiler that translates Tiny ML programs into machine code for Mach, an abstract machine written in OCaml.

For detailed information about this project, please see the assignment documents: [hw7.pdf](/docs/hw7.pdf) and [mach.pdf](/docs/mach.pdf).
